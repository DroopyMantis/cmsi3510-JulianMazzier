I have an asus ROG Zephyrus laptop, it has an AMD 9 5900HS proccessor with 8 cores. My GPU is an Nvidia RTX 3070. For memory I have 16 gigs of ram and 1T of storage on an SSD. I have 582 gigs free. The display is a 16 inch 165 hz screen, atached to my pc I have a keyboard, a mouse, and an adapter for a bluetooth headset.
I have 1 usb-c to usb adapter since my machines doesnt have enough usb ports. I'm currently running Windows 11 for my OS.
