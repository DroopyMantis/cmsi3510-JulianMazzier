Hi, I’ll be writing my technical write up as it applies to a windows system as it’s the operating system that I use the most.The first major component involved is the bootloader. Its main function is to initialize the operating system's kernel and transfer control to it after it runs some process. In a Windows system, the bootloader is managed by a component 
called the Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr).The first thing your bootloader will do is the execute the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).Bios is tied to a master boot record (MBR system) which limits disk size to 2TB. Bios also has a slower and generally less secure boot compared to UEFI. UEFI uses the GUID Partition 
Table (GPT) which removes the size constraints and offers a faster and more secure boot.Then the POST (Power on Self Test) is run to make sure all the hardware is working correctly.After the POST, the BIOS/UEFI gives control to the Windows Boot Manager. The Boot Manager then loads information from the Boot Configuration Data (BCD), which contains details about the 
operating system and how to start it. The Windows Boot Loader (Winload.exe) then starts. This program loads the Windows kernel (ntoskrnl.exe), essential drivers and other system files needed for the hardware and software to communicate and start the system. At this point, Winload has passed control to the kernel and the bootloader has finished its job. Windows 
handles initialization using the Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe) and other related components instead of Unix-based systems like systemd or System V init. Once the kernel is initialized, the first user-mode process started is the Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe). The Session Manager sets up the user-mode environment, initializing system sessions, and 
starting the initial process for the system. It sets up paging files, creates system environment variables, and initiates the Winlogon process. The Winlogon process handles user logins and provides security for the login process. It launches the LogonUI, which displays the login screen, allowing the user to enter credentials. Then starts the Local Security 
Authority Subsystem (lsass.exe), which handles authentication. After login, a user session is created, and explorer.exe starts, setting up the desktop and interface, allowing users to interact with the system and run applications.
