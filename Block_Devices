All screenshots are attached in the Disk_Screenshots PDF. I have 2 disk drives physically attached to my computer, an SSD which is 250 Gigabytes and an HDD that is 1 Terabyte. My HDD only has 1 partition that is the basic data partition, I use this disk for general storage and for applications that I don’t really care about the performance of.
On my SSD I have 3 partitions, a recovery partition that is 499 MB, an EFI system partition that is 99 MB, and the rest of the drive that handles boot, page file, crash dump, and basic data partition. I found these on my machine by running windows+x and going to disk management. To see the volumes mounted on my root system I was able to run
Get-Disk and Get-Volume in windows powershell. Get-Disk shows me the name, serial number, health status, operational status, size, and partition style of my disk. Get-Volume similarly shows some of the same values and additionally the drive type, remaining size, and the friendly name. For the the sources to see what commands to run to view
all of the information about my disks I used openAI’s chat gpt as it gives very clear instructions for what commands you need to run toview the block devices in your system.
